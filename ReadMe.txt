FindRoute.java- This is main class. Created connection to the nodes and virtual edges and performed uniform cost search.
ConnectingPath.java: This class contains the target nodes for connection. In other words it establishes the edges between nodes.
Node.java: Class contains the state of the node, cumulative cost and adjacent edges info.
Input1.txt: Place the text file that needed to be used as reference.
